# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Bell-South/ArgusTrack.git
cd ArgusTrack

# Install dependencies
pip install -r argus_track/requirements.txt

# Install package
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Process GoPro video with real-time visualization
python -m argus_track.main input_video.mp4 --model yolo_model.pt --show-realtime

# Batch processing without visualization
python -m argus_track.main input_video.mp4 --model yolo_model.pt --no-realtime
```

### Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**

- **ExifTool** (optional, for GPS extraction)

---

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Usage Guide**

### Step 1: Prepare Your Data

#### Option A: GoPro Video with GPS
```bash
# Your GoPro video already contains GPS metadata
# Argus Track will automatically extract it
ls your_gopro_video.mp4  ✅
```

#### Option B: Video + Separate GPS File
```bash
# Create GPS CSV file with format:
# timestamp,latitude,longitude,altitude,heading,accuracy
echo "timestamp,latitude,longitude,altitude,heading,accuracy" > gps_data.csv
echo "0.0,-34.123456,-56.789012,100.0,45.0,2.0" >> gps_data.csv
```

### Step 2: Prepare Your Model

```bash
# Train YOLOv11 model or use pre-trained model
# Model should detect classes like: "Led-150", "Led-240", "light_post", etc.
ls yolov11_lightpost_model.pt  ✅
```

### Step 3: Basic Processing

```bash
# Real-time processing with visualization
python -m argus_track.main video.mp4 \
    --model model.pt \
    --show-realtime \
    --output-video output_visualization.mp4
```

**Real-time Controls:**
- `q` - Quit processing
- `p` - Pause/resume  
- `s` - Save screenshot

### Step 4: Batch Processing

```bash
# High-speed batch processing
python -m argus_track.main video.mp4 \
    --model model.pt \
    --no-realtime \
    --json-output results.json \
    --csv-output gps_data.csv
```

### Step 5: Advanced Configuration

```bash
# Fine-tune detection and processing
python -m argus_track.main video.mp4 \
    --model model.pt \
    --detection-conf 0.15 \        # Lower confidence threshold
    --gps-interval 10 \             # Process every 10th frame  
    --disable-static-car \          # Disable stationary frame skipping
    --verbose \                     # Detailed logging
    --log-file tracking.log
```

### Step 6: Analyze Results

6,0.100,-34.123467,-56.789023,100.1,45.3,2.0
```

### Step 7: Performance Monitoring

Check processing logs for efficiency metrics:
```bash
# Look for efficiency statistics
tail -f tracking.log | grep -E "(Progress|Skipped|Processing)"

# Processing efficiency: 87.5% reduction in processed frames
```

## 🔧 **How It Works & Problems Solved**

### Core Innovation: GPS-Informed Tracking

Traditional object tracking systems suffer from three critical problems when tracking infrastructure from moving vehicles:

#### Problem 1: Track Fragmentation
**Issue:** Same light post gets multiple track IDs as vehicle moves past
```
Frame 10: Light Post → Track ID 1
Frame 15: Same Light Post → Track ID 3 (fragmentation!)
Frame 20: Same Light Post → Track ID 7 (more fragmentation!)
```

**Solution:** GPS movement context prevents impossible track resurrections
```python
def _resurrection_makes_temporal_sense(self, track_id, detection, frame_id):
    distance_traveled = self.vehicle_speed * time_since_death
    
    # KEY INSIGHT: If vehicle moved >15m, this CANNOT be same object
    if distance_traveled > 15.0:  # meters
        return False  # Block resurrection
```

#### Problem 2: Processing Inefficiency  
**Issue:** Processing every frame is wasteful for infrastructure mapping
- 60fps video = 1800 frames for 30 seconds
- Most frames contain redundant information
- Vehicle stationary = same objects visible

**Solution:** Smart frame selection with GPS movement analysis
```python
# GPS Synchronization: Process every 6th frame (10fps effective)
if not gps_sync.should_process_frame(frame_id):
    skip_frame()  # 83% reduction

# Static Car Detection: Skip frames when vehicle isn't moving  
if vehicle_stationary_for(5_seconds):
    skip_frame()  # Additional efficiency gain
```

**Result:** 75% fewer frames processed while maintaining accuracy

#### Problem 3: Impossible Track Resurrections
**Issue:** Tracking systems allow logically impossible track reuse
```
Vehicle at Position A: Track ID 5 (Light Post)
Vehicle moves 50m forward to Position B  
Vehicle at Position B: Track ID 5 reused (IMPOSSIBLE - same post 50m behind!)
```

**Solution:** GPS-based resurrection validation
```python
# Temporal Logic: Use vehicle movement to validate track resurrection
if self.vehicle_moved_distance > self.MIN_DISTANCE_DIFFERENT_OBJECT_M:
    forbid_track_resurrection(old_track_id)
    assign_new_track_id()
```

```

### GPS Motion Prediction

The system uses GPS data to predict where objects should appear in the next frame:

1. **Calculate Vehicle Movement**
   ```python
   # Convert GPS lat/lon changes to vehicle movement in meters
   translation_x, translation_y = calculate_translation_meters(gps_prev, gps_current)
   vehicle_movement = VehicleMovement(translation_x, translation_y, speed, heading_change)
   ```

2. **Predict Screen Displacement**
   ```python
   # For static objects, apparent movement is opposite to vehicle movement
   apparent_x = -vehicle_x  # Vehicle moves East → objects appear to move West
   apparent_y = -vehicle_y  # Vehicle moves North → objects appear to move South
   
   # Convert to pixel displacement using camera parameters
   angular_x = apparent_x / object_distance_m
   pixel_displacement_x = angular_x * pixels_per_radian_horizontal
   ```

3. **Match Predictions to Detections**
   ```python
   # If detection is within tolerance of prediction, it's the same track
   if distance_to_prediction < prediction_tolerance_px:
       assign_existing_track_id()
   ```

### Smart Frame Processing

#### GPS Synchronization
```python
# Original: 60fps video = 1800 frames/30sec
# GPS Data: 10Hz = 300 GPS points/30sec  
# Processing: Sync to GPS timeline = 300 frames processed
# Efficiency: 83% reduction (1500 frames skipped)
```

#### Static Car Detection  
```python
# When vehicle is stationary (< 0.3m movement for 5+ seconds):
# Skip all frames - objects already captured when vehicle first stopped
# When vehicle resumes movement: Resume normal processing
# Additional efficiency: ~50% of remaining frames in urban environments
```

### Track Memory Management

```python
class TrackMemory:
    """GPS-informed track management"""
    
    # Conservative resurrection policy for forward motion
    MIN_DISTANCE_DIFFERENT_OBJECT_M = 12.0  # 12m travel = new object
    MAX_TIME_SAME_OBJECT_S = 2.5            # 2.5s max for same object
    FAST_SPEED_THRESHOLD_MS = 5.0            # Restrictive policy when fast
    
    def should_allow_resurrection(self, track_id, detection, frame_id):
        """GPS movement validates if track resurrection makes sense"""
        distance_traveled = self.vehicle_speed * time_since_track_death
        
        if distance_traveled > self.MIN_DISTANCE_DIFFERENT_OBJECT_M:
            return False  # Vehicle moved too far - different object
            
        return True  # Resurrection allowed
```

### Output Generation

#### JSON with GPS Coordinates
```python
# Every processed frame includes:
frame_data = {
    "timestamp": frame_timestamp,
    "detections": [detection_with_track_id, ...],
    "gps": {
        "latitude": current_gps.latitude,
        "longitude": current_gps.longitude,
        "heading": current_gps.heading,
        "accuracy": current_gps.accuracy
    }
}
```
